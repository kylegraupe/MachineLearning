# MachineLearning
This repository is meant to serve as a portfolio of the different ML projects and scripts I create.

Feel free to look at my projects. I do not keep my intellectual property on this site.

I recently took the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate courses through Coursera to demonstrate that my understanding of ML concepts is acceptable by 
industry standards.

I draw inspiration from some of the labs in those courses to create these programs as practice. 

This portfolio includes:
  1) PyTorch ML program that compares performances using different activation functions in Neural Networks. 
  2) PyTorch ML program that compares performances of different size and shape Neural Networks. 
  3) PyTorch ML program that compares performances using neuron dropout versus no neuron dropout.
