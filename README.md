# MachineLearning
This repository is meant to serve as a portfolio of the different ML projects and scripts I create.

Feel free to look at my projects. I do not keep my intellectual property on this site.

Overview:
Over the last several months, I have been working towards my mastery of the machine learning discipline. Although, I have a long way to go before I am an expert in the field, I am making steady progress. I am working to transition from my background in aerospace and marine industries to software and machine learning. Although this is not going to be an easy task, I am willing to put in the work to reinvent myself as a young professional. Below are some of the things that I am working on or have completed on this journey. Feel free to take a look and do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to contact me regarding employment opportunities. 

Books:
  1) I have read "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurelian Geron. I am in the process of bringing those examples into this    repository.
  2) I next plan to read "Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision" by Vallappia Lakshmanan.

Certificates:
  1) I recently took the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate courses through Coursera to demonstrate that my understanding of ML concepts is acceptable by 
  industry standards. I draw inspiration from some of the labs in those courses to create these programs as practice. 

This portfolio includes:
  1) IBM AI Engineering Specialization Professional Certificat capstone project. It compares two pretrained neural networks, VGG16 and ResNet50. It uses GPU         acceleration through the cuda toolkit.
  2) A ML program that I have been working on to predict the premium of an option premium, specifically the premium of a put contract. (Work in Progress).
  3) A simple MNIST Classifier using Neural Networks in Keras.
  4) A simple MNIST Fashion classifier using Neural Networks in Keras.
  5) PyTorch ML program that compares performances using different activation functions in Neural Networks. 
  6) PyTorch ML program that compares performances of different size and shape Neural Networks. 
  7) PyTorch ML program that compares performances using neuron dropout versus no neuron dropout. 
  
  And more to come!
