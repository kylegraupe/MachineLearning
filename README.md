# MachineLearning
This repository is meant to serve as a portfolio of the different ML projects and scripts I create.

Feel free to look at my projects. I do not keep my intellectual property on this site.

I recently took the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate courses through Coursera to demonstrate that my understanding of ML concepts is acceptable by 
industry standards.

I draw inspiration from some of the labs in those courses to create these programs as practice.
